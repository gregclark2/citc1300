        <h2>Paul Gilbert</h2>
        <p>
            Paul Gilbert has been a huge influence on all sorts of guitar players.
            Back in the day, he was one of the two guitarists in a band called Racer X.
            Both guitarists in the band were graduates of the Guitar Institute of Technology, which was a
            big deal at the time. Their music included ultra-fast tempos, string-skipping
            acrobatics, sweep arpeggios, and the theatrical use of a power drill to pick.
            Some said this was an homage to Jimmy Page having used a violin bow or that it was the
            only way he could pick fast enough to keep up with the fingers on his left hand.
            Still others said it just sounded cool. Pardon the video qualityâ€¦in times
            past we recorded on something called &apos;VHS tape.&apos;
