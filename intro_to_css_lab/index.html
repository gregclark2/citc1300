            <h3>An Expatriate Artist</h3>
            <p>John Singer Sargent was an American expatriate painter, watercolorist, and draughtsman.  He was born in 
                Florence, Italy in 1856 when a cholera outbreak stopped his parents' journey through Europe.  His artistic
            studies led him through a brief period at L'Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence before travelling to Paris.  In Paris,
        Sargent would study at both L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts and in the studio of Carolus-Duran (the portait of whom, painted by Sargent,
        is pictured below.)  </p>

            <h3>Sargent and Writers</h3>
            <p>
            Sargent became a celebrated portaitist and both painted and sketched the portaits of many prominent artists, writers,
            and socialites, many of whom were Sargent's friends.  Many of Sargent's portaits were provided interesting
            points of intersection between great visual art and great written art.  Three of the literary luminaries Sargent painted or
            sketched (often multiple times) were the novelists Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson and the poet William Butler Yeats.
