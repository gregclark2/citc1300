    <h2>Good News, Everyone!</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Well, buckle up, buckaroos, because Hulu has announced that it has reached an agreement with the team
        behind the much-loved - but chronically-cancelled - series Futurama, for a whopping twenty new episodes.
        Futurama fans greet the announcement of a new run of episodes with both great excitement and not just a little
        trepidation,
        because, if the past is any guide, a fresh slew of episodes often presages a sudden and heartbreaking
        cancellation. </p>

    <p> First aired in March of 1998 on the Fox Network, Futurama was not so much cancelled as ignored
        into oblivion by network executives until the network simply stopped buying new episodes in 2003. Syndication
        rights were then picked up by the Cartoon Network and then soon afterward by Comedy Central. Revived interest in
        the series led to 4 direct-to-DVD films which were later split up into a new season on Comedy Central in 2008.
        By this time the Cartoon Network had stopped airing its reruns. A precarious three-year run on Comedy Central
        produced no less than FOUR designated series finales due to the uncertain future of the show. So, ladies and
        gentlemen, it has been a rocky road, but with Hulu committing to at least twenty new episodes, it looks like... for the
        moment, at least: </p>
